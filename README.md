### **What It Does / Problem It Solves**

Polyglot Media Analyzer is an **AI-powered tool for real-time, multilingual video intelligence**.
It ingests live-streamed or uploaded video content (e.g., news, podcasts, lectures, corporate calls) and:

* **Transcribes speech** in multiple languages.
* **Generates summaries & insights** (who‚Äôs speaking, what topics are covered, sentiment).
* **Detects key visuals** (logos, people, objects) to automatically tag video metadata.
* **Creates short highlight reels** from the most informative or engaging sections.

This solves a **real-world business problem**: global companies and media organizations need quick, scalable ways to **index, summarize, and repurpose massive volumes of multilingual media content** for internal knowledge sharing, compliance, and audience engagement.
